《Visualizations of Deep Neural Networks in Computer Vision A Survey》

two key questions:
RQ-1 Which insights can be gained about DNN models by means of visualization?
RQ-2 Which visualization methods are appropriate for which kind of insights?

visualization goals：
 General Understanding:理解神经网络的一般行为
Architecture Assessment:理解网络的哪一层代表哪些特性（如颜色，纹理等等）
Model Quality Assessment:确定网络的层数以及每一层在可视化过程中扮演的角色
User Feedback Integration: 

visualization methods：
Histogram
Pixels Display
Heat Map
Similiarity Layout
Confusion Matrix
Node-link diagram

computer vision tasks
classification
